# Anti-Phising-Prediction-System
Phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and prevalent, posing a significant threat to individuals and organizations. An anti-phishing prediction system is an essential tool to detect and prevent these attacks. This project aims to develop an anti-phishing prediction system using machine learning algorithms to analyze email content, URL links, and user behavior to detect patterns that indicate a potential phishing attack. The system utilizes content analysis, URL analysis, and user behavior analysis to detect and prevent phishing attacks. The project involves training and testing the machine learning models using a large dataset of labeled phishing emails and websites, as well as legitimate emails and websites. The primary objective of this project is to build an effective anti-phishing prediction system to help prevent cyber attacks and protect sensitive information.<br><br>
